# Npm Package

I am trying my hand at creating an `npm` package.

It will include `types`, `tests` and `github` `CI/CD`.

## Progress Update

I was using a tutorial I found in my mail but it sucked and skipped a lot of steps so I am gonna shelve this for now and try again with something more comprehensive.
